# The Logoverse: Matter as Markdown, Boundaries as Code Fences
In the Logoverse, reality is text — rendered by default in Markdown, the lingua franca of ideas. This isn't just a choice of format; it's a metaphysical stance. All things visible begin in documentation. The “matter” of the Logoverse is Markdown, a view-only substrate of meaning that’s instantly human-readable and inherently forkable.

But between the words lie the boundaries — not firewalls or permissions, but code fences. These triple-backtick markers are sacred thresholds where raw Markdown ends and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) begin. A ```gno block is not just executable — it is world-altering. It carries intention, logic, and authority to mutate the state of the Logoverse.

## State as Substance, Language as Lens
In Gno.land, state is first-class. It's durable, observable, and composable. But the state doesn’t exist in a vacuum — it's continuously expressed through multiple language views:

JSON for machines

SVG for spatial or structural logic

Markdown for humans

Here, the medium is the message — not metaphorically, but literally. How a thing is rendered defines how it is understood, interacted with, and extended. Markdown shows you the what. Gno code defines the how. SVG maps the where. JSON structures the why.

Each DSL you insert via code fence — whether it’s pflow, sprite, bmp, or event — becomes a local law of physics for its realm. It defines what “action” means, what “truth” can be stored, and what kind of future can unfold.

## Agency Through Framing
Frames (like GnoFrames or schema.org containers) are the organizing principle — akin to UI windows, CLI contexts, or game engines. But in Gno.land, a frame is an object, not an interface. It contains logic, metadata, and view templates. Interacting with a frame is not merely user interaction — it is user participation in the evolution of logical space.
