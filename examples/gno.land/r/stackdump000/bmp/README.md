# r/stackdump000/bmp

This package contains a collection of bitmap images that are used in the Gno.land project.
The images are stored as raw data, and are rendered using SVG.


Depending on the number of colors used, images can be up to 50x50 pixels in size while still small enough to render in gnoweb.
